**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Aung Kyaw**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
 
I only used CodePath prework guide

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
 
The most significant challenge that I have throughout this prework was adding the sound to the game buttons. It is my first time I learn about adding a sound to my program. At first, I just tried to understand it by reading the written code and explanation below the code but I did not understand which function is producing the sound. So, I hardcoded to my IDE each function first and tested my program to find out how the code is worked. Another thing that gave me a hard time was playing a sequence of clues. I think it is the most important UI part of the game because it is showing the visual clue to the game player. Therefore, I was careful a lot about this part and made sure to understand the concept before I moved on to the next part. At this time, I read and hardcoded the code on my IDE first so it would make a little more sense before I read the explanation. In addition, I learned a few tips about the console so each time the button changed the color, I could see on my console which helped me throughout this process. After all, most of the part was going well throughout my prework.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I realized that web development is an interesting thing while I am doing this prework. At the same time, I want to know a lot of things about web development. I have heard from some people that web development is really hard and it take a lot of peopleâ€™s work to complete the project. I was wondering if it is true and if it is true how long does it take time to complete and how much do people need? In addition, a lot of websites generator like wix.com are popular nowadays. I am wondering what is the difference between a website that I wrote and a website created by a web generator?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would definitely add additional features that are described as optional features in README.md.  First of all, instead of just a color on the button, I want to put an image of a music note so that the game UI looks better. In addition to the game, I want to make the game more balanced. I would like to add more game buttons from four to six to increase the difficulty of the game. As I added more buttons to a game, I would give three life to the player since the game is harder with more buttons. Moreover, I think adding a timer in a game so it would give a player a certain amount of time to finish the turn. The time would be from 3 seconds for the easiest level to 30 seconds for the hardest level. If a player would fail to finish within a certain time, one life would be taken away.
